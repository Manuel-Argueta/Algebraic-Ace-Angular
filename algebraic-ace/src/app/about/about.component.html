                    <h2><u>Why Algebraic Ace?</u></h2>
                    <h3>I decided to create Algebraic Ace in order to spread the love that 
                        I have for mathematics in my community. I believe that all teenagers 
                        deserve to see the beautiful and fun side of mathematics; to get rid of the 
                        idea that math is just the annoying and difficult subject at school. Algebraic
                        Ace is meant to allow kids to not only practice some basic math skills and 
                        arithmetic, find fun and valuable resources, but also to allow them to share their 
                        experiences with mathematics.

                            and I have been a part of Urban TXT for about a year now.
                            They have allowed me to delve into both the world of computer science and 
                            profesionalism. I love to code in all kinds of
                            programming langauges; however, some of my favorite languages 
                            are Javascript and Python. My favorite school subject is 
                            mathematics because it allows to gain a perspective of the 
                            world through the language of the universe.
